This project contains test cases and usage examples for LightDA. It contains the following example implementations:

- advect1d, a 1-D advection solver

## Advect1d

Advect1d is a 1-d advection solver. It translates an arbitrary function through a periodic 1-D domain. The example code contains an observation defintion for point observations of the advected quantity, and a forward operator that predicts those point observations from the model state.
